# DSCI 100 PROJECT 

In this project, we will utilize a synthetically generated dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability) containing over 3000 observations, each representing a sample of water. Each observation contains nine variables that affect water potability (pH, hardness, total dissolved solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity) as well as a score indicating whether or not the water is potable. Using this dataset, we aim to demonstrate how a classification model can be trained to accurately evaluate whether or not an unknown sample of water is potable based on measurable variables.
